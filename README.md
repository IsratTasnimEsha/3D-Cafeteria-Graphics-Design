## **Introduction**

### **Background**

This project presents a 3D interior design of a cafeteria that combines functionality and creativity. The design incorporates a variety of elements such as tables, chairs, mirrors, sinks, sofas, and lighting to create a vibrant and welcoming environment. Dynamic features like a sliding door, adjustable lighting modes, and realistic object movements bring the space to life. This project demonstrates how 3D modeling, transformations, and interactive elements can be combined to create an engaging virtual experience.

### **Objectives and Goals**
- *Functional and Aesthetic Design*: Design a cafeteria that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing, incorporating essential elements like furniture, lighting, and appliances.
- *Interactive Elements*: Implement interactive features like sliding doors, moving curtains, and lighting adjustments to create a dynamic experience.
- *Realistic Lighting*: Simulate different lighting conditions, including ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting, with dynamic adjustments based on the time of day.
- *User Control*: Allow users to control various elements, such as the movement of objects, the opening and closing of doors, and the adjustment of lighting.

## **Methodology**

### **Cafeteria Design**

#### *Setup*
- The cafeteria includes key furniture like tables, chairs, and sofas, designed with geometric shapes like cubes and cylinders.
- Essential elements such as mirrors and sinks are created with hollow hexagons and cylinders to simulate real-world functionality.
- Textures are applied to objects for realistic surface details.

#### *Mechanics*
- The cafeteria features a sliding door that can be opened and closed using user input.
- Lighting includes point lights, spotlights, and directional lights, with user controls to toggle them on and off.

### **Lighting and Objects**

#### *Lighting*
- Dynamic lighting is used to simulate different times of the day, adjusting the environment from morning to night.
- Point lights illuminate specific objects, while spotlights focus on key areas like tables and sinks.
- Directional lights simulate natural daylight, adjusting the ambiance as time progresses.

#### *Objects*
- **Tables and Chairs**: Created using cubes, textured to represent wood or fabric surfaces.
- **Sinks and Mirrors**: Designed with hexagons and cylinders, creating realistic reflections and functionality.
- **Lighting Fixtures**: Designed using cylinders and torus shapes, with adjustable intensities and colors.

### **Dynamic Features**

#### *Moving Objects: Translation*
- The cafeteria includes a sliding door that can be opened and closed, controlled by user input.
- Curtains move based on user interaction, adding a touch of realism to the space.

#### *Moving Objects: Rotation*
- The ceiling fan rotates when activated, adding to the dynamic feel of the cafeteria environment.

#### *Daylight Simulation*
- The lighting adjusts dynamically based on the time of day, from morning through evening, ensuring realistic environmental changes.
